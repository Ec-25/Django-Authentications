# Django Authentication Modules by Ec25
To use any of these modules you must first install the dependencies in your virtual environment.
If you do not have a virtual environment first believe one:

```
> python -m venv env
> env/Scripts/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:
```
(env)> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And ready, feel free to use the module that best suits your needs.
